# **Monte Carlo Simulation and Single Server Queue Model**

This repository contains Python scripts for two simulations:
1. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A visualization of estimating the value of π (Pi) using a Monte Carlo approach.
2. **Single Server Queue Model**: A simulation of a single-server queuing system to analyze customer wait times and service efficiency.

---

## **Features**

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Estimates the value of π using randomly generated points.
- Provides real-time visualization of points inside and outside the unit circle.
- Compares the area ratio of a diamond to a square for reference.

### Single Server Queue Model
- Simulates a queue with random arrival and service times.
- Computes and visualizes metrics such as average wait time, queue length, and server utilization.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Run `python3 -m venv myenv` to create the environment.
2. Activate it with `source myenv/bin/activate`.
3. Install packages as needed with `pip install <package-name>`.
